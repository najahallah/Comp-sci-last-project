    <h2>How to play ASSASSIN</h2>
    <p id="mastertext">Assassin (also Gotcha, Assassins, KAOS (Killing As Organized Sport), Juggernaut,
        Battle Royal, Paranoia, Killer, Elimination, or Circle of Death) is a live-action game.
        Players try to eliminate each other from the game using mock weapons in an effort to
        become the last surviving player. After registering, you will be assigned a target to
        "kill". In this version of the game, you must kill any and all members of the game. The last one standing wins.
        <strong>All players must follow the Rules of Conduct below to play.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Rules of Conduct</h2>
    <div id="mastertext">
        <ol>
            <li>Each person for themselves. You may team up, but remember. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.</li>
            <li>If you decide to team up, only you may execute your target. If your accomplice kills your target, the death does not count.</li>
            <li>The <strong>only accepted ways</strong> to "kill" someone are:
                <ul>
                        <li>"Poison": Salt their water</li>
                        <li>"Bomb": Stick a timer on their seat or in their bag</li>
                        <li>"Sniper": Hit them with a water in the neck (only allowed outside of school).
                            Other body parts hit with water do not count.
                        NOTE: Water guns, and other similar weapons are <strong>prohibited</strong> on school property.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>If you are killed, you must give your name and PIN to your killer.</li>
            <li>Use the honor system. Don't be a butt and give the wrong pin or deny being killed.</li>
            <li>Have fun and stay safe!</li>
    </ol></div>
